    <p>A web designer is an individual that makes their living by designing and maintaining web sites. This is a field that has evolved extremely quickly over the past decade, but the fundamentals still remain the same. Any web designer must have a strong understanding of the HTML language. Contrary to what most people believe HTML is not a programming language, but a formatting language developed by <strong>Tim Burners-Lee</strong> since its original development HTML has come a long way and has incorporated a multitude of new features. HTML allowed for the development of the World Wide Web and the explosive popularity of the Internet!</p>
        
    <p>As HTML evolved, developers soon realized that the structure of the web pages should be defineed using HTML, and the pages style, look, and feel, should be defined separately, thus the birth of cascading style sheets. Now developers use HTML to define what the information on the web page is, such as a heading content, article content, a paragraph within the article, or footer content, etc. Cascading sheets were designed to define the colors of document, the size, margins, colors, and positioning of the various elements of the web page.</p>
        
    <p>About the time the HTML and the World Wide Web were hitting the public sector, PHP was being developed to make web pages a more powerful tool. PHP is a scripting language that is written directly on the web page and interpreted by the web server which would send the final version of the web page to the visitor's browser. About a year later, <strong>Netscape</strong> released the first version of JavaScript, under the name Mocha which later became LiveScript, and then JavaScript. JavaScript is also a scripting language, but unlike PHP, JavaScript is interpreted ability to interact with a database, but still provides processing functionality to a web page. Web designeres now days must not only be proficient in HTML and CSS, but a variety of scripting language as well. Even though HTML was the first language of the web, many more have come along, but it still remains the fundamental structure that the web page is built from.</p>
